## Description
Tucked away near Market St., you'll find the Mean Mug's South location. The old brick and weathered wood give the interior a cozy, homey feel. 

### Location
<div class="mapouter"><div class="gmap_canvas"><iframe width="600" height="500" id="gmap_canvas" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Mean%20Mug%20Coffeehouse%20South&t=&z=15&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><a href="https://www.crocothemes.net">crocothemes.net</a></div><style>.mapouter{text-align:right;height:500px;width:600px;}.gmap_canvas {overflow:hidden;background:none!important;height:500px;width:600px;}</style></div>

## Pros

* Best damn sausage, egg and cheese bicuit in town
* Free refills

## Cons

* Older building means it's much colder in the winter. You'll definitely want layers if you plan on staying for a while
* Street parking can be limited, but there are pay lots in front of and behind the shop
*
